# Releases found in [here](https://github.com/VincPlyz/V-Paxels/releases/tag/release)


V-Paxels uses the new component capabilities to add craftable and functional paxels
------
V-Paxels:
- 2 Paxel Types (Diamond -Upgrade-> Netherite)
- 1 Charm (Charm of Mining Reach I-III)
- No Ticking Commands
- Custom Resourcepack (Optional but Recommended)
- a probably too complicated ability to switch between plow and path mode (hoe and shovel right-click)
------

there a few things that dont work how i want it so here is a list of things i will add/change as soon as i know how to do it and/or mojang added the needed Components

- Axe rightclick action switch

- ~~Upgrading Diamond Paxels to Netherite using the Smithing table (A way to keep/copy components to the new item)~~

- ~~allowing you to switch between >Right Click< actions e.g. Shovel = Path and Hoe = Farmland (me and Mojang Problem)~~
- ~~Giving Paxels more Range (me problem)~~
- ~~more Durability (me problem)~~
